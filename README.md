This is a website made for an FSD bootcamp at Geekshubs academy. The content (pictures, descriptions and dishes) were taken from <a href="https://thebegan.es/en/home/">The Began</a> and translated. This was made in 5 evenings.

## Roadmap 

- **Add pictures to the food cards** - Food cards will have pictures showing what they are. This was delayed due to not having the official pictures for all dishes.

- **Make the menu title text more responsive** - So that it follows better the expected possition at all times.

- **Fix the vertical overflow that occurs on some screen sizes in the footer**

- **Add a phone interactive button** - To allow users to automatically dial the contact number when on phone.

- **Add a review section to Home** - To make it feel more complete.

## Known Issues

- In some screen sizes there is some vertical overflow in the footer.
- In some screen sizes the header stops following its regular format and displays too small.
